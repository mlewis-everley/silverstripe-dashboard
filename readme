Please see the file INSTALL for install instructions:

A very basic dashboard that displays recently the 10 most recenly edited pages,
10 most recently uploaded files and all unmoderated comments.

This project makes use of the Crystal "Open Source" Icon set found at:

I will try and add new features on a semi regular basis but any issues, comments
or feedback please post on the forums, mailing list or Sourceforge project page
(https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=280040).

Or you could email me at m.lewis.everley@googlemail.com
